        "Inner Product (Dot Product) The inner product takes two vectors of the same size, multiplies their corresponding elements, and sums the results. This operation produces a single scalar value and is often used to measure the similarity or alignment between two vectors. For example, given [1,2] and [3,4] the inner. product is calculated as, (1 * 3) + (2 * 4)=11.\n",

This operation generates a structured set of values, often used in applications like constructing grids or rank-1 tensors. For instance, for [1,2] and [3,4],the outer product involves (1 * 3), (1 * 4), ( 2 * 3), (2 * 4), yielding [3,4,6,8].\n",
